# Preface

Note

“I remember years back when this new language called “JavaScript” came out.
It sounded interesting, so I bought a big, thick reference book on the language and read it cover to cover.
When I finished, I couldn’t write JavaScript to save my life.
My problem was that I hadn’t written any programs in the language.
I’ve since learned better how to learn a language, which is perhaps the most valuable skill you can develop as a programmer.
When I want to learn a language now, I start by rewriting things I already know like Tic-Tac-Toe.”
